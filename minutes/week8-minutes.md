## Minutes:
- James was selected to write minutes today.
- All we need to do today is continue our Collaboration (also called communication) diagrams. 
- Along with this we need to draw our Client Server Experiment Diagram.
- Once we have finished all of this, we should have everything done for this deliverable.
- We are reviewing our class skeletons.
- Little to no changes need to be made at this time.
- We all worked off the same format, so there was very little discrepancy between the skeletons
- Connor completed the UI mock-ups to the rest of the teams satisfaction.
- We are using the board today to explain how the API will work. Understanding this is key to our Client Server Experiement Diagram
- The Collaboration Diagram is next.
- We encountered no problems with this either, as with most things during this deliverable.
-  We plan to meet up on Friday to compile all parts of this deliverable into one document.
