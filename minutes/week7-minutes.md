## Minutes

- Michael was selected to write minutes.
- We reviewed previous additions and got started with the Refined Class Diagram.
- Jake drew this up while the rest of us contributed verbally.
- There were no difficulties and we were all in agreement for how it should be presented.
- We reviewed what we had done so far and started on the State Machine Diagram.
- We agreed to have an expanded view of _Make Move_.
- Jake was selected to draw the up the diagram.
- Draw.io was used as a resource.
- We set up the diagram with minimal disagreement.
- The State Machine Diagram is now complete and still open to further discussion if needed.
- The Object Diagram was our next task.
- Jake was selected again to draw it up, and used Draw.io to do this.
- Collaboration went smoothly with no disagreements.
- This was completed swiftly and we moved on to other tasks.
- We then started the Sequence Diagram.
- Again, Jake was the one to draw this out while the rest of us assisted verbally.
- Our first diagram was for the creation of the game.
- This was done, and we moved on to the next scenario.
- The next diagram we chose was for swapping letters.
- There was confusion about whether the Letter class should be included, but we decided in the end that it was better to exclude it, as it was only being passed as a parameter.
- The rest of the diagram was completed and we committed everything to GitHub.
- We spoke about what we have covered and were satisfied so far.
- We theorized about what to do for our next meeting and wrapped things up.
