Explanation for Client server experiment:
We plan to write our web server using Flask (Python) and by making use of Sockets
to ensure that both players are kept "up to date" and seeing the same data i.e
the board and the words on it.
With socket Io messages are passed from client to server and back to the other client.
We also plan to use a Restful API to get and update values from the server to the 
client and back. This would occur when a player performs a certain action 
for example swap letters on a rack or passing a turn.
